Recreate the classic game breakout

* Notes
** Ball
   - trybounce
   - takes a paddle and blocks, and returns what type of thing the ball bounced off
   - first check if it hit a wall
   - then check if it hit a block
     - if so, hit the block and see if it is destroyed

** DONE Set up SDL2
** DONE Set up basic game loop
** DONE Set up paddle input
** DONE Ball physics
